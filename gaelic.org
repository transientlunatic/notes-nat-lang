** Personal pronouns
   
** Nouns
*** Number
    Gàidhlig has three numbers, singular, dual, and plural.

    The dual is identical in form to the singular for masculine nouns, and identical to the locative case for feminine nouns.

    _Example_
    dà bhalach - Two boys
    dà craoibh - Two trees 

** Verbs
*** The infinitive & verbal noun

        The infinitive can be formed by aspirating the verbal noun, and prefixing the particle a' (or a dh' if the verb starts with a vowel or f).

    _Examples_
    pòsadh → a phòsadh
    ag òl → a dh'òl

    
    
*** Mood
**** Conditional
**** Imperative

*** Tense
**** Present tense

     There is no specific present tense in Gàidhlig, and instead it relies on the use of a copula, such as /is/, or the verb /bi/ and the verbal noun.
     This is similar to English, and the present tense can be imitated by casting a sentence in the progressive aspect.

     _Examples_
     /Tha mi a' dol ann/ - I'm going there, lit. I go there.
     /Tha mi a' bruidhinn/ - I speak, lit. I am at speaking.

     It is also possible to use the future tense if the action is habitual.

     _Examples_
     /Ithidh mi a' bhiadh a h-uile latha/ - I eat food everyday, lit. I *will* eat food every day.

**** Future tense

    


*** Bi
    The verb "to be". Often considered the "substansive be" compared to /Is/ which is used as  a copula.

    _Paradigm_

    | Present affirmative |              | Present negative |                 |
    |---------------------+--------------+------------------+-----------------|
    | tha mi              | I am         | Chan eil mi      | I am not        |
    | tha thu             | You are      | Chan eil thu     | You are not     |
    | tha e/i             | He / She is  | Chan eil e/i     | He / She is not |
    | tha sinn            | We are       | Chan eil sinn    | We are not      |

    | tha iad             | They are     | Chan eil iad     | They are not    |
    | thatar              | There is     | Chan eilear      | There is not    |

    
    The present dependent is used with the particles "an" or "a" for an affirmative question, or "nach" for a negative question.
    The bh is dropped, however, in the negative.

    | Present dependent |              |                |               |
    |-------------------+--------------+----------------+---------------|
    | a bheil mi        | Am I?        | nach eil mi    | Am I not?     |
    | a bheil thu       | Are you?     | nach eil thu   | Are you not?  |
    | a bheil e/i       | Is he / she? | nach eil e/i?  | Is he not?    |
    | a bheil sinn?     | Are we?      | nach eil sinn? | Are we not?   |
    | a bheil sibh?     | Are you?     | nach eil sibh? | Are you not?  |
    | a bheil iad?      | Are they?    | nach eil iad?  | Are they not? |
    | a beilear?        | Is there?    | nach eilear    | Is there not? |

    The habitual present tense (e.g. I swim every day) is represented in the future tense in Gàidhlig.
